# Olena Collins Individual Project

### Problem Statement

Tennis Universe is one of the largest Tennis and Fitness clubs in the Midwest. It offers a wide variety of services and playing opportunities to 
tennis enthusiasts of all levels and abilities. Currently, Club’s staff has to enter members’ personal information into a spreadsheet, which does not 
guarantee data not being overwritten or corrupted. Also, front desk staff is overloaded with calls from Club members trying to book court time, a 
lesson, or other service. 

Develop website for the ‘Tennis Universe’ Tennis and Fitness club. The site will contain comprehensive information about the club services. There will 
be an option to log in to the system for authorized persons and add/delete/update/view club members’ information.

The system will allow Club members to log onto the site and book a court, or a lesson.The system will calculate monthly charges for each member. 

The system will generate a monthly Newsletter to all members that subscribed to receive it, and send it via email.
