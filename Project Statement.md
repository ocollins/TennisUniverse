# Olena Collins Individual Project

### Problem Statement

**Tennis Universe** is one of the largest Tennis and Fitness clubs in the Midwest. It offers a wide variety of services and playing opportunities to tennis enthusiasts of all levels and abilities. Currently, Club’s staff has to enter members’ personal information into a spreadsheet, which does not guarantee data not being overwritten or corrupted. Also, front desk staff is overloaded
with calls from Club members trying to book court time, a lesson, or other service. 

Develop a website for the ‘Tennis Universe’ Tennis and Fitness club. The site will contain comprehensive information about the club services. There will be an option to log in to the system for authorized persons and add/delete/update/view club members’ information.

The system will allow Club members to log onto the site and book a court, or a lesson.

The system will calculate monthly charges for each member. 

The system will allow members to calculate calories burned during various types of exercises.
